# Restaurant-Rating-Prediction-and-Recommendation-System

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict restaurant ratings, creating a recommendation system based on user preferences, and performing geographical analysis of restaurants using Plotly Express scatter plots.

## Task 1: Predict Restaurant Ratings [Random Forest Regressor]

### Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on other features.

### Approach
We utilize a Random Forest Regressor algorithm to predict the rating of restaurants. This ensemble learning method is well-suited for regression tasks, providing robust predictions by combining multiple decision trees.


## Task 2: Restaurant Recommendation [Cosine Similarity]

### Objective
Create a restaurant recommendation system based on user preferences.

### Approach
We employ cosine similarity to recommend restaurants to users based on their preferences. By measuring the cosine of the angle between two vectors representing user preferences and restaurant features, we can identify restaurants that are most similar to the user's tastes.


## Task 3: Location-based Analysis [Plotly Express Scatter Plot]

### Objective
Perform a geographical analysis of the restaurants in the dataset.

### Approach
We use Plotly Express to visualize the geographical distribution of restaurants through scatter plots. This enables us to explore patterns and trends in restaurant locations, helping us understand their spatial distribution.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of restaurant information including features such as location, cuisine type, cost, and user ratings. It serves as the foundation for training the machine learning model and building the recommendation system.
